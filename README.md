## DOMAIN OF CHOICE: Airbnb

1. **Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
 We are interested in Airbnb because everyone in the group has used and enjoyed the service. We are also interested in exploring how the tourist accommodation market, which has been dominated by hotels, hostels, and motels, and pricing have changed overtime, since it has become much more accessible to a larger audience of people. Services such as Uber, Doordash, Fiverr, where individuals offer services is only something that has come about relatively recently, and as one of the most prominent ‘brokers’, our group believes it is important to find the impact Airbnb will have on the future.

2. **What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**
We found a project which tried to correlate price to the amount of Airbnb activity.
